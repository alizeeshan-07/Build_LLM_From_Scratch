## üìö Study Tips

### üîç **Deep Understanding Approach**
- **Read before coding**: Understand concepts before implementation
- **Code from scratch**: Don't just copy-paste, type everything
- **Experiment actively**: Change parameters and observe effects
- **Visualize everything**: Use plotting functions to see what's happening
- **Ask "why" questions**: Understand the reasoning behind design choices

### üõ†Ô∏è **Practical Learning Strategy**
- **Start small**: Begin with tiny examples and simple cases
- **Build incrementally**: Add complexity step by step
- **Test frequently**: Verify each component works before moving on
- **Keep notes**: Document your insights and discoveries
- **Debug systematically**: Use print statements and visualization

### ü§ù **Community Learning**
- **Join discussions**: Participate in GitHub issues and discussions
- **Share implementations**: Show your code for feedback
- **Help others**: Teaching reinforces your own learning
- **Document discoveries**: Add to the project documentation

## üß† Mathematical Prerequisites Review
